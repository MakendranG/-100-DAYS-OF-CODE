# #100 DAYS OF CODE CHALLENGE

### I accepted the 100 Days of Code Challenge to improve and learn something new every day for at least an hour. That way, I can enhance my coding skills.

* I Will Follow Two Basic Rules: 

     1. Code for at least one hour per day for the following 100 days.
   
     2. Every day I'm going to update on LinkedIn with my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
